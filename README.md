# Sailing School

Hi, welcome to my Sailing School project!

The initial idea was to set up a web site for a sailing school, focused on begginer's lessions for children. I wanted the design to be minimalistic, easy to navigate and comprehend, which was (hopefully) achieved in this project.  The webiste is designed for parents that wish to sign their children up for sailing lessons. Keeping in mind that the intended user might not be tech savvy and needs a simple website that does what it says, the design for this project was achieved.

## Features

The project requirements were to use HTML and CSS to do so, therefore the initial document was index.html linked with a style.css spreadsheet. The idea for index.html was to have a nav bar above an image with 2 buttons in the center of the image. The navigation bar consists of a logo on the left and the links to where-to-find-us.html and contact-form.html, while the buttons in the centre lead to begginer's guide.html and the timetable displayed under the central image in index.html. The main colors of the project are various shades of blue and white, to achieve good visibility. 
To achieve the minimalistic style, I didn't add a lot of text, nor features, just the basic information about the sailing club accompanied by a timetable of the sailing lessons on index.html, basic instructions on how to reach the location on where-to-find-us.html, and a form with contact us in the contact-form.html. 

### Existing Features
* __Navigation Bar__ 
The navigation bar is present on all other html files (with exception to begginer's-guide.html), it consists of 4 items, a logo that leads back to index.html, and a Home, Location and Contact Us clickable links that lead back to index.html, as well as where-to-find-us.html and contact-form.html. It is responsive and allows the user to navigate between the pages easily on all devices, ranging from a phone to a desktop.

* __Set Sail__ 
The Set sail section consists of an background image of sailboats on the sea and in the centre of the image are two buttons. The first button Sailing Lessons leads directly to the timetable further down the page, while the Begginer's guide opens begginers-guide.html in a new tab. The begginers-guide.html consists of an embbeded youtube video where the basics of sailing are described.
